# Windows-specific configuration:
# pytesseract is only a Python wrapper around the Tesseract OCR *engine*.
# On Windows, the engine is not automatically found on PATH after installing
# it, so we point pytesseract directly at the installed executable.
#
# If Tesseract was installed to a different location on your machine, update
# the path below to match (check with, e.g.,
#   Test-Path "C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe"
# in PowerShell).
#
# On macOS/Linux this line is not needed (tesseract is normally on PATH after
# `brew install tesseract` or `apt-get install tesseract-ocr`), so it is safe
# to comment out or remove there.
